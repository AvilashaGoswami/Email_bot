# Email Automation bot
This Python-based automation model streamlines the process of sending emails to multiple individuals or organizations without requiring the user to manually draft each email.
The script securely accesses email credentials stored in a local file on my device, ensuring privacy and preventing disclosure. It also utilizes a dataset containing customers' email addresses and tailored email content specifications.
By analyzing the dataset, the code identifies customers who meet the criteria for receiving a reminder email. It then generates and sends personalized emails to all qualifying recipients simultaneously from my email account.
